							<h1>Welcome to Songscape</h1>
                            <p>Songscape is an exploration into songs' expansion across the world and the cultural trends of music taste that arise between and within nations. Observe popular songs' evolution and associations in our geographical and semantic analysis.</p><p class="small"></p><p>
                            In our modern globalised world, music is more accessible than ever. The rise of the internet and streaming services have meant that in the majority of countries on the planet, anyone can listen to music from almost anywhere.</p><p class="small"></p><p>
							This project investigates the new Global Musical Landscape. Using data analysis and visualisation we are exploring the flows of music across the globe, the musical identities of individual countries, and how these identities relate to and potentially affect one another.</p>	
							<p>We have divided our research project into three scales: Global, Local and Semantic. We invite you to discover each phase one by one and to move deeper into the exploration of our world’s music.</p>
                            <br><br>

                            <p>With the advent of globalisation and the internet, pop music has become a ubiquitous presence across the world. Just minutes after the release of an American pop musician’s new album, listeners from China to Chile will be streaming the songs through services like Spotify. This is a marked shift from earlier times, when music often wasn’t recorded and it could take years for instruments and techniques to permeate across cultures. Even in the 20th century, which saw the emergence of popular styles such as rock, jazz and blues, the process of distributing CDs or cassettes and the geographical limitations of radio meant that it could take years for Western pop music to reach the more peripheral and closed off regions of the world.</p>
<p>Spotify and other streaming platforms have made recorded music (both Western and from the rest of the world) far more accessible for ordinary people. What we intend to examine is the extent to which Western pop music has pervaded the musical cultures of other countries – what are their listening habits? What languages feature in the music they listen to? Have traditions of local pop music endured the introduction of Western pop, or even appeared in response to it? What similarities are there between the musical and lyrical contents of Western pop songs and other cultures’ domestic pop music?</p>
							
							<p>With approximately 43% of the streaming market share (<a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/music-subscriptions-passed-100-million-in-december-has-the-world-changed/">MIDiA Research, 2016</a>) and streaming making up 50% of total recorded music revenues (<a href="http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/GMR2017.pdf">IFPI, 2017</a>), Spotify represents ~20% of all digital music revenues, and so an incredibly large section of all music consumption.</p>
							
<p>By conceptualising the different ways cultures may resist or be influenced by Western pop, we will have an idea of how cultural phenomena such as music diffuse across cultures and the global networks that facilitate these processes. Looking at music also gives us an insight into broader questions of how cultures may retain, lose or reformulate their identities when faced with globalisation.<p>
<p>Our work builds upon studies into globalisation and music such as <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093650215623834">Verboord and Brandellero's</a> multilevel analysis of music flows and <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002764211398081">Achterberg’s</a> work on the globalisation of European consumers’ musical taste . Both studies showed a steady internationalisation of pop music in countries around the world between 1960 and 2010, and linked the ‘Americanization’ of pop music with America’s economic dominance and centrality in the global music industry. We believe that the digital age brought a paradigm shift in music consumption – compared to the days of buying CDs in shops, streaming offers a wider variety of choice than any physical shop could offer, as well as the ability to explore new forms of music without having to spend money on a CD first. This should lead to consumers musical choices becoming internationalised to an even greater degree than these studies observed. Furthermore, our study looks at a greater number of countries from South America and Asia.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our lyrical analysis goes beyond record sales as a metric of the influence of music on culture to look at how song lyrics have been affected by the recent wave of musical globalisation. This novel methodology distinguishes us from previous studies into music and cultural globalisation.</p>
